# Note!
This repository is a fork that supports 4.2+ Blender versions. It is built with Python 3.11, which is currently bundled into Blender.

It has changes to the build process, making it easier to update in the future.


# Mtree

Mtree (previously Modular Tree) is a library for making 3d trees. It comes as an addon for blender but the c++ library can be used separately.

## Installation (blender addon)
Go to the [latest release]. Under `Assets`, select the version corresponding to your os.

Follow the [Blender documentation][blender addon doc] to install the downloaded addon.

## Development
### Dependencies
- [Cmake]
- Blender 4.2 or higher

### Installation
1. Clone the repository reccursively `git clone https://github.com/ethanporcaro/modular_tree_py311`
2. Generate Cmake files with `cmake -S src -B build`
3. Build the project with `cmake --build build`
3. If all went well, your addon will be generated and zipped to `modular_tree_{platform}.zip` where `{platform}` is the name of your operating system.


### Usage
A `Tree` is generated by executing a succession of `TreeFunction`. When being executed, a `TreeFunction` modifies the structure of the tree, and then calls children functions recursively.\
For example, a basic tree has a trunk and branches on the trunk. Such a tree can be generated as such:
```c++
auto trunk = std::make_shared<TrunkFunction>();
auto branches = std::make_shared<BranchFunction>();
trunk->add_child(branches); // branches are added on top of the trunk
Tree tree(trunk);
tree.execute_functions(); // The tree structure is generated
ManifoldMesher mesher; // A mesher is responsible of converting a tree into a 3d mesh. The ManifoldMesher ensures a smooth topology
mesher.radial_resolution = 32;
Mesh tree_mesh = mesher.mesh_tree(tree); // the resulting mesh contains the geometry of the tree in the form of vertices and triangles
```
A second layer of branches can be grown on top of the branches by adding another branch function as a child of the first branch function: 
```c++
auto branches_primary = std::make_shared<BranchFunction>();
auto branches_secondary = std::make_shared<BranchFunction>();
branches_primary.add_child(branches_secondary); // the secondray branches will be distributed on top of the primary branches
```
Some trees have healthy branches as well as a layer of thin dead branches along the trunk. This can be achieved by adding to branch functions with different parameters on the trunk:
```c++
auto trunk = std::make_shared<TrunkFunction>();
auto branches_healthy = std::make_shared<BranchFunction>();
auto branches_dead = std::make_shared<BranchFunction>();
branches_dead.length = RandomProperty{.1f,1f}; // dead branches will have a length between 10cm and 1m.
branches_dead.start_radius = ConstantProperty{.05f}; // dead branches will have a radius equal to 5% of the parent nodes

trunk->add_child(branches_healthy); // both sets of branches are grown on top of the trunk
trunk->add_child(branches_dead);
Tree tree(trunk);
```
